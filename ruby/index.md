# Ruby

[Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) caught me on the first sight. Its simplicity makes it irresistible.

No intention to learn [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) too, but it may still happen once. In meantime, only CLI script will be here.

## My favorite Ruby features

* Suitable for quite compact one-liners.
* Better readability with statement modifiers, `unless` and `and`, `or`, `xor`, `not` between expressions.
* JSON-like array and hash literals.
* Statements have return values.
* Flexible use of `break`, `next`, `redo`.
* Anonymous `Proc`s.
* Functions are first-class citizens.
