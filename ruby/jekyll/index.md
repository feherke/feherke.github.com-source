# Jekyll Plugins

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a blog-aware static site generator. It is simple and rigid. Yepp, sorry, but Jekyll not met my expectations.

These plugins try to add some basic functionalities the Jekyll engine misses. Nothing special. Some of them should be doable without plugins.

Note  
You can **not** use these plugins on GitHub. Own plugins are not allowed. You have to generate the site on your own machine then upload the resulted files.
