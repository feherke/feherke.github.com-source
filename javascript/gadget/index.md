# Desktop Gadgets

[Desktop Gadgets](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/gadgets) are small
tools, without traditionally framed windows, which sit on the desktop and do
their jobs. Mostly not interactive jobs.

Sadly they are quite limited in accessing system resources. ( Or I just missed
the tricks to reach other data then those provided by the API. )

Warning !  
As a measure of security do **not** install Desktop Gadgets from untrusted
sources without proofreading them.
