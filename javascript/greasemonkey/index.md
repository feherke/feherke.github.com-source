# Greasemonkey Scripts

[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) is an extension for the [FireFox](http://mozilla.com/firefox/fx/) web browser. It executes
[user scripts](http://userscripts.org/) which can alter the document's content and functionality.

The Greasemonkey scripts are plain old JavaScript scripts able to access the DOM, but additionally can make use of a tiny [API](http://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:API)
to accomplish additional tasks. This makes it a powerful but somehow dangerous tool to enhance the browser's capabilities.

Warning !  
As a measure of security do **not** install Greasemonkey scripts from untrusted sources without proofreading them.
