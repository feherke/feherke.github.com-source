# Python

[Python](http://python.org/) is the representant of the freedom I prefer in programming languages : no attribute and method visibility limitation.

## My favorite Python features

* List and dictionary comprehension.
* `False`, `None`, 0, 0.0, \'\', \[\], and {} are false, anything else is true.
* JSON-like list and dict literals.
* Anonymous `lambda` functions.
* Functions are first-class citizens.
