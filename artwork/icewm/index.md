# IceWM Theme

[IceWM](http://www.icewm.org/) is the most comfortable window manager I ever met. It has everything I need and very few I not need.

I especially enjoy the way it can be configured : with ``$EDITOR``. ( Yes, I know there are GUI configurators, but sorry, I do not like them. )

Even more, if your patience allows it, you can draw the theme decorations too with ``$EDITOR``. However, I preferred to edit the images with [GIMP](http://gimp.org/)
first, then only to fine tune them with with text editor when needed.
