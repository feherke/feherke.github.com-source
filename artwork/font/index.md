# Font

Font I draw with [FontForge](http://fontforge.org/) and many sweat.

Initially I intended to start up with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and draw the entire SVG font then just conver it to whatever I need, but this prooved to be hard
without considerable theoretical knowledge about fonts and rendering. But once in a future... maybe...
