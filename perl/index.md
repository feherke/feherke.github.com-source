# Perl

[Perl](http://perl.org/) is the beauty and a beast. I mean, both of them.

## My favorite Perl features

* Suitable for quite compact one-liners.
* Better readability with statement modifiers, `unless` and `and`, `or`, `xor`, `not` between expressions.
* 0, \'0\', \'\', (), and `undef` are false, anything else is true.
* Many special variables to reflect internal states.
* JSON-like array and hash literals.
* Possibility to find out if the `sub`'s caller `wantarray`.
* Flexible use of `goto` and lables.
* Flexible use of `next`, `last`, `redo`.
* Anonymous `sub`s.
* Functions are first-class citizens.
